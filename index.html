                        Anne Burdick diagnoses the profession's addiction to novelty, exposing how designers preach function while chasing trends. She reveals a cycle where styles are consumed overnight in the relentless pursuit of the new.

                            Steven Heller attacks design schools for producing deliberately ugly work in the name of experimentation. He argues that ugliness without purpose threatens the profession's credibility and creates style without substance.

                            Ellen Lupton argues that style isn't shallow but a complex cultural code. She demonstrates how style communicates identity and taste, challenging Modernist binaries that dismiss it as mere decoration.

                    <h2>Design's Identity Crisis</h2>
                    <p>
                        The 1990s brought graphic design to a breaking point. As computers democratized the profession and consumer culture accelerated, designers found themselves torn between Modernist principles and postmodern chaos. Steven Heller's "Cult of the Ugly" (1993) attacked graduate school experiments as self-indulgent, warning that "ugliness as its own virtue diminishes all design." Anne Burdick's "Neomania" (1992) diagnosed the profession's addiction to novelty, admitting "we design to indulge our obsession with the visual." Ellen Lupton's "Under the Surface of Style" (1995) defended style as meaningful, calling it "an outward sign of difference." The contradiction was clear: designers preached function while competing on aesthetics, denounced formalism while reveling in it, and spoke of timeless principles while chasing constant reinvention. These essays capture a profession fighting over its identity when yesterday's innovation became today's cliché.

                            Designers used to stand for beauty and order. Now beauty is passé and ugliness is smart. How did we get here and is there any way out?
